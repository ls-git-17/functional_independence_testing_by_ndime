# functional_independence_testing_by_ndime

This repository contains the R code for the paper Krzyśko M., Smaga Ł., Wydra J. (2025). Distance of mean embedding for testing independence of functional data (under review). The R files contain the code for the new methods of the paper. They are organized as follows:

- `functional_ndime_mdime.R` - the functions for the permutation NDIME and mNDIME tests for pairwise and mutual independence,
- `example_for_pairwise_independence.R` - the illustrative application of permutation tests implemented in `functional_ndime_mdime.R` to the generated data example for pairwise independence testing for functional data,
- `example_for_mutual_independence.R` - the illustrative application of permutation tests implemented in `functional_ndime_mdime.R` to the generated data example for mutual independence testing for functional data.

**Remark.** The computation of the permutation tests may take some time.
